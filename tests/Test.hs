-- | **REMINDER**
-- This level is not an isolated module to complete. This level exists as one
-- starting module: `test/Test.hs`. Which you are to import your most recently
-- completed `Application` to be tested.
--
-- As you progress through the course, you are encouraged to return to this
-- `test/Test.hs` and update it so you're able to be confident that your
-- application will behave as you expect. You may also write your tests before
-- you write your functions, this can be useful when trying to think through a
-- problem.

-- | This is the only location for tests as you progress through the course.

-- | This module starts our very sparse. There are only the imports required to
-- have these initial tests work. Additional tests are for you to build. and may
-- require you to import other modules as you require.
--
-- As you progress through the levels, the initialisation of the 'app' will
-- become more complicated as more components are introduced. Part of the
-- exercise is to work out how to integrate your application with this testing
-- framework.

-- | 'tasty' takes care of managing all of our test cases, running them,
-- checking results and then providing us with a report.
import           Test.Tasty         (defaultMain, testGroup)

-- | 'tasty-wai' makes it easier to create requests to submit to our
-- application, and provides some helper functions for checking our assertions.
import           Test.Tasty.Wai     (assertBody, assertStatus', get, post,
                                     testWai)

-- | For running unit tests for individual functions, we have included the
-- 'tasty-hunit' package. More information is available on the Hackage page:
-- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit.

-- you move forward, come back and import your latest 'Application' so that you
-- can test your work as you progress.
