-- | We will use this function to describe how we would like our `CommentText`
-- type to be encoded into JSON.
--
-- Waargonaut knows how to encode a `Text` value, we need a way of telling it
-- how to unwrap our newtype to encode the `Text` value inside.
--
-- We _could_ write the code to unpack or pattern match on the `CommentText` and
-- then run the `Text` encoder using that value as input before returning that
-- as the result of our Encoder. Something like this:
--
-- @
-- encodeA $ \(CommentText t) -> runEncoder text t
-- @
--
-- But like many of the tasks that we've been completing in this course, the
-- plumbing for such a thing has already been written for us. Sometimes the
-- instances of the structure we're trying to create may provide a handy
-- shortcut.
--
-- In this case the `Encoder` type has an instance of `Contravariant`. That
-- typeclass has a function that comes in very handy when writing these
-- functions. There is a quick introduction to `Contravariant` in the `README`
-- for this level.
